This project focused on using classical machine learning techniques for computer vision tasks. The goal was to understand how traditional models can classify images after basic image processing and feature extraction. Images were converted into numerical data and used to train and test machine learning models, allowing the system to recognize visual patterns. Through this work, I learned the strengths and limitations of classical approaches, especially when compared to deep learning methods. The project was completed using Python in a Jupyter notebook environment, mainly in Google Colab, with libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn.
