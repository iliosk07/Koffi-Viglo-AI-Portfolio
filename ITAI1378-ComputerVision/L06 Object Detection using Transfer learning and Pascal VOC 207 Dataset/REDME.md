# CNN-Based Image Classification: Chihuahua or Muffin Lab
This assignment is about learning object detection using TensorFlow and the Pascal VOC dataset. Instead of just telling what an image is, object detection also shows where the objects are with boxes around them. I used a pre-made Jupyter Notebook and ran it in Google Colab (or SageMaker) so I could use a GPU for faster processing. I followed the steps to set up the environment, checked that the GPU or TPU was available, and loaded the SSD MobileNet V2 model to detect objects in images from Pascal VOC 2007.
From this assignment, I learned the difference between image classification and object detection, and why GPUs/TPUs are important for computer vision tasks—they make training and running models much faster. I also got practice with loading datasets, using pre-trained models, and running detection on images. This showed me how AI can identify multiple objects in an image at once and why choosing the right hardware matters for efficiency. It also made me more comfortable using TensorFlow and Colab for real AI tasks.
