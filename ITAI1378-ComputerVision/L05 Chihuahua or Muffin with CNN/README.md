# Chihuahua or Muffin with CNN
This lab is about using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images in the “Chihuahua or Muffin” dataset. I cloned the GitHub repository, opened the notebook in Google Colab, and ran all the cells, making sure the code worked and outputs were visible. I experimented with the CNN by changing things like the number of layers, learning rate, and epochs to see how it affected the model’s accuracy.
From this lab, I learned how CNNs automatically extract important features from images, unlike the traditional neural networks we used before. I also saw how different model settings impact performance and training time. The lab taught me the full deep learning workflow: from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and experimentation. I reflected on challenges like tuning parameters and handling errors, and I thought about real-world applications like object recognition and quality control. I also considered ethical aspects, such as fairness and bias in image classification models. Overall, this lab gave me hands-on experience with CNNs and a better understanding of how deep learning improves image classification.
