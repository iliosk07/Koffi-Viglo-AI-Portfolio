# Image Processing Fundamentals
This lab is about learning the basics of image processing and understanding how computers see and manipulate images. I worked with Google Colab to load images, look at their properties like size and color channels, and convert them to grayscale. I also adjusted brightness and contrast, applied filters like blur and edge detection, and did geometric transformations like scaling and rotation. Later, I explored creative effects by combining techniques and connected traditional image processing methods to AI tools like Nano Banana.
From this lab, I learned that images are really just numbers in a matrix, and simple math operations can change how they look. I got hands-on experience with filters, histograms, and transformations, which helped me understand the math behind visual effects. I also saw how traditional methods relate to AI, which makes me appreciate how much modern tools build on these fundamentals. This lab showed me how image processing is everywhere—from phone cameras to AI applications—and encouraged me to experiment and think creatively about how to use these techniques.
