# Exploring Real-World Applications of Computer Vision
This assignment is about exploring a real-world computer vision application to understand how it works, the technology behind it, and its effects. I had to choose an application like facial recognition, self-driving cars, or medical imaging, then research it to see how computer vision is used and what other technologies are involved. After that, I wrote a short analysis describing the application, explaining the technology behind it, and discussing its benefits and challenges. Finally, I reflected on the future of the application and how it could impact society, both positively and negatively.
From this assignment, I learned how computer vision is applied in real life and not just in theory. I understood the role of technologies like AI, sensors, and image processing in making these applications work. I also learned to think critically about the advantages and drawbacks, including ethical and practical issues. Overall, it showed me how technology can solve real problems but also bring new challenges, helping me see the bigger picture of innovation and its impact on society.
