# computer Visoin 
This project focused on the basics of image processing. The goal was to understand how images are represented as data and how simple operations can be applied to modify or improve them. I worked with techniques such as image resizing, filtering, and different image transformations. This project helped me better understand the role of image processing in computer vision systems and provided a foundation for more advanced projects in the course.
