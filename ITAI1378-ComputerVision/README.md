# Computer Vision – ITAI 1378

## Course Overview
This course introduced the fundamentals of computer vision and how machines can understand and analyze images. The class combined theory with hands-on practice, allowing me to build real computer vision applications using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Most of the work was completed in Google Colab, which helped me focus on experimentation and results rather than environment setup.

## Image Processing and Visual Understanding
At the beginning of the course, I worked with basic image processing concepts such as image loading, resizing, filtering, and transformations. These activities helped me understand how images are represented as data and how simple operations can improve or change visual information. I also explored real-world applications of computer vision in areas like healthcare, security, and automation.

## Classical Machine Learning for Computer Vision
The course then moved into using traditional machine learning techniques for image-based tasks. I practiced feature extraction and applied classical models to classify images. This part of the course helped me understand the limitations of traditional methods and why deep learning is often preferred for complex visual problems.

## Deep Learning and Image Classification
Later in the course, I worked with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. I built and trained models to distinguish between visually similar objects, and I observed how CNNs significantly improved performance compared to classical approaches. This section strengthened my understanding of neural network architectures, training processes, and evaluation metrics.

## Object Detection and Transfer Learning
I also implemented object detection models using transfer learning with a standard public dataset. This work involved detecting multiple objects within an image rather than classifying a single object. Through this project, I learned how pre-trained models can be adapted to new tasks and how to evaluate detection performance.

## Visual Language Models
Toward the end of the course, I explored Visual Language Models (VLMs), which combine vision and language understanding. This part of the course introduced multimodal AI systems and showed how images and text can work together in modern AI applications.

## Midterm Project
For the midterm, I developed a project proposal that clearly defined a computer vision problem, identified the dataset to be used, and explained the planned approach. This assignment helped me practice project planning, problem formulation, and technical communication.

## Final Project
The final project brought together the skills learned throughout the course. I designed and implemented a complete computer vision solution, including data processing, model development, evaluation, and analysis. This project demonstrated my ability to apply computer vision techniques to a real problem in an end-to-end manner.

## Tools and Technologies
Throughout the course, I used Python along with libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. All projects were developed using Jupyter notebooks, primarily in Google Colab.

## Learning Outcome
By completing this course, I gained a strong foundation in computer vision, from basic image processing to deep learning and multimodal models. I am now comfortable building, evaluating, and documenting computer vision projects using modern AI tools.
