# Midterm Project Proposal – Computer Vision and AI
This assignment is about planning a realistic computer vision project. I need to define a real-world problem, explain why it matters, and describe a practical solution I can build with the time and resources available. I will create a GitHub repository with a clear structure, including a README, optional notebooks, dataset info, and my proposal slides. The slides should cover the problem, my solution, technical approach, data plan, system pipeline, success metrics, weekly timeline, challenges, and required resources.
From this assignment, I learned how important it is to plan carefully before coding. It taught me how to break a project into clear steps, justify technical choices, and anticipate challenges. I also gained experience thinking about metrics, data sources, and resources in a real-world context. This proposal helps me practice communicating a project idea clearly and ensures that my project is achievable, organized, and ready for development.
