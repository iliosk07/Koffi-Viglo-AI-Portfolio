# Final Project Summary – Smart Helmet and Jacket Detector
In this project, I built a safety helmet and reflective jacket detection system using YOLOv8, a deep learning model for object detection. First, I collected and prepared the dataset from Roboflow, which included images of people wearing helmets, reflective jackets, or neither. I explored the dataset and displayed sample images to understand the data visually.
Next, I ran a pre-trained YOLOv8 model on some sample images to test basic detection performance. This helped verify that the model could recognize objects like helmets, jackets, and people before training on my dataset. I then trained the YOLOv8 model on my dataset for 10 epochs, adjusting parameters to achieve better accuracy. After training, I ran predictions on test images, which showed the model detecting helmets, jackets, and people with bounding boxes.
Finally, I performed a quantitative evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, and mAP to measure the model’s performance. I also organized all results and images in Google Drive for easy access. This project demonstrates how AI can enhance safety monitoring by detecting helmets and jackets automatically in real-time images, which could be useful in workplaces or construction sites.
