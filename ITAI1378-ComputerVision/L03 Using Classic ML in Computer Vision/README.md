This assignment is about learning classic machine learning techniques for computer vision. I had two choices: either explore many feature extraction methods (like SIFT, HOG, LBP, and edge detection) and multiple ML algorithms, or focus deeply on building an image classifier using SVM. I picked one lab and worked through it using OpenCV and scikit-learn, running code to extract features, train models, test performance, and answer reflection questions. I also documented my steps and results in Markdown cells in the notebook.
From this assignment, I learned how traditional machine learning works for images, including how to turn pictures into features that a computer can understand. I saw how different algorithms perform on the same data and learned how tuning parameters can change results. This lab helped me understand the full pipeline from feature extraction to classification and gave me a solid foundation for more advanced AI methods later.
