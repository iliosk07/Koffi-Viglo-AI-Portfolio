# Image Processing Adventure Quest – Vision Legends

This assignment is about learning the basics of image processing in a fun, creative way. Each group chooses a “realm” like pixels and color models, image formats, enhancement, segmentation, or libraries like OpenCV and Pillow, and completes a challenge in that realm. We then present our findings through something creative—like a comic, skit, video, or storybook.
From this assignment, I learned how image processing concepts work in practice, like how pixels and color models represent images, how enhancement techniques change images, and how libraries like OpenCV and Pillow make these tasks easier. I also learned how to explain technical ideas creatively and work as a team to communicate complex concepts in an engaging way. It was a fun way to combine technical learning with storytelling and design skills.
