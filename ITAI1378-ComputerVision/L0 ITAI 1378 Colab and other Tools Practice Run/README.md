# Using Classic Machine Learning in Computer Vision

This project focuses on applying classical machine learning techniques to computer vision tasks. The main goal was to understand how traditional models can be used to classify images and to compare their behavior with more advanced deep learning approaches.

In this project, images were processed and converted into numerical features that could be used by machine learning algorithms. These features were then used to train and test classification models, allowing the computer to recognize visual patterns in the data.

The project helped highlight the strengths and limitations of classical machine learning in computer vision. While these models can work well for simpler problems, they often struggle with complex images compared to deep learning models.

All work was completed using Python in a Jupyter notebook environment, primarily in Google Colab. Libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn were used for image processing, model training, and evaluation.

By completing this project, I gained a better understanding of how traditional machine learning techniques fit into the broader computer vision workflow and why deep learning methods are often preferred for more complex visual tasks.
