# Colab and other Tools Practice Run
This assignment is about learning how to use GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks. First, I created a GitHub account, explored the website, made a new repository called “jupyter-exploration,” and learned how to make my first commit. Then, I used an online environment (Google Colab) to create my first Jupyter Notebook. I added a Markdown cell with text and a code cell that printed “Hello, World!” and ran the cells to see the results. Finally, I saved the notebook, downloaded it, and uploaded it to my GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop.
From this assignment, I learned how to use GitHub for version control and share my work online. I also got hands-on experience with Jupyter Notebook, learning the difference between Markdown and code cells, and how to run Python code interactively. I realized that these tools make it easier to organize work, track changes, and collaborate with others. It also taught me patience because sometimes committing and pushing files took a few tries to get right. Overall, it gave me a solid start with two tools that are essential for programming and data science.
