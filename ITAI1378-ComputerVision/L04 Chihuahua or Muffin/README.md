# Computer Vision
This lab is about learning image classification using a fun “Chihuahua or Muffin” dataset. I cloned a GitHub repository to Google Colab, opened the notebook, and worked through all the exercises. The exercises taught me how to prepare image data, extract features, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance in classifying images as either a chihuahua or a muffin. I saved my work in Colab and prepared a reflective journal summarizing what I did, what I learned, and the challenges I faced.
From this lab, I learned how machine learning can recognize patterns in images and make predictions. I got hands-on experience with the full process: loading data, training models, testing them, and interpreting results. It also showed me the importance of clean data and careful evaluation. I realized that even small image differences can affect model accuracy, and proper techniques are needed to handle this. Overall, this lab gave me practical insight into image classification and how these methods could be applied in real-world scenarios, like automated detection or quality control.
